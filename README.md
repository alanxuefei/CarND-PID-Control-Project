# PID controler

In 1922, a engineer Nicolas Minorsky noted the helmsman steered the ship based not only on the current course error (Proportional), but also on past error (Integral), as well as the current rate of change (Derivative). After trials, the performance of PID control is better than most helmsman.

The P-Controller outputs a correction by multipling the Error with the proportional Gain. The main problem of the P-Controller is that it tends to overshoot. 

The D-Controller outputs a correction by multipling the current change of Error. the correction reacts to fast changing errors. input signals. Combining the P-Controller with the D-Controller can help solve the overshooting problem.

The I-Controller outputs a correction by accumulating the previous errors. The integral is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously (e.g. Systematic Bias).

# Tuning of parameters

  The parameters presented along Sebastian Thrun's PID class were used as start point. Then these parameters are turned manually based on the offset errors. 

Step 1, I started with the P control. 
  * P control 
   The proportional only mode result in overshoot (offset error).

Step2, Then I add the D control. 
  * PD control 
   The overshoot issue can be solved by derivative action, which multiplies the current change of error. For example, the derivative action notice that the error become small and reduce the steer value.

Step3, Finally I add the I control.
  * PID control 
   The integral in a PID controller is the sum of the instantaneous error over time and gives the accumulated offset that should have been corrected previously (e.g. Systematic Bias). In this case, the effect of the I controler is very low.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
